Events tracked:
1. Clicks with inner text and element tag
2. selected text
3. entered keystrokes with the element data(can be used to identify copying of text too, not done yet though)
4. monitor pointer location and display a heatmap (not currently used for narrative text generation)
5. clicked urls
6. total time spent on page
7. curent webpage url

NOTE: I have decided on using the sidepanel as my main dashboard. The popup will show just basic info but is not being updated currently

Future plans:
1. monitor all elements total time in view till now and use the top 5 elemets data as part of promt
2. track img downloads
3. track native media play and also through yt api for embedded vidoes
   
4. resolve major bugs like not opening the sidepanel raises errors as the heatmap data cant be sent, etc

NOTE: I use a baground color change just for testing puposes.
